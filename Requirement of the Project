1. Objective
To analyze and visualize key U.S. macroeconomic indicators in order to:

Understand the relationship between monetary policy, inflation, and interest rates.

Identify structural shifts (regimes) in economic policy using data science techniques.

Provide actionable insights for policymakers, investors, and academic researchers.

2. Stakeholders
Primary: Economic analysts, policy researchers, and academic institutions.

Secondary: Investors, financial journalists, and general data science learners.

3. Business Questions
How do changes in money supply (M2) influence inflation over time?

What is the lag between changes in interest rates and observable inflation responses?

Can we classify monetary policy periods (regimes) based on CPI and Fed Funds Rate behavior?

How tightly are different interest rate instruments (SOFR, 10Y Yield, Fed Rate) correlated?

4. Scope
Included: U.S. monthly data from 2018 to 2025 for M2, CPI, Inflation Rate, Fed Funds Rate, SOFR, and Treasury Yield.

Excluded: Global indicators, labor market data, GDP growth, or sector-specific metrics.

5. Tools and Technologies
Data Handling: Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: KMeans clustering (scikit-learn)

Version Control: GitHub

Documentation: Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, MS Word

6. Deliverables
Cleaned and documented dataset

Time series visualizations and correlation analysis

Regime clustering model (KMeans) and visual interpretation

Final report with recommendations, assumptions, and caveats

GitHub repository with README and supporting files

7. Success Criteria
Clear, interpretable visualizations of trends and correlations

Accurate clustering of economic regimes

Actionable insights derived from exploratory analysis
